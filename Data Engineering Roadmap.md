*This roadmap guides you from beginner to senior data engineer in clear phases, based on real industry experience and hiring expectations.*

## 🧭 **Exploration**, *clarity not skills* 
*Before learning anything, make sure you understand the role clearly so you know what you’re signing up for before investing your time and effort.*

**Data engineering** is not not about flashy visuals, dashboards or charts — it’s about systems, pipelines, fixing issues, and working behind the scenes. 
It’s about <b>building the data foundation</b> that everything else depends on.

As a data engineer, your job is to:

- Move data between systems
- Clean messy, unreliable data
- Build pipelines that run every day
- Fix things when they break

Your work is often invisible, but when data is wrong or missing, everyone feels it. This role is less about writing perfect code and more about solving real data problems. 
You’ll debug frequently, investigate failures, and learn how data systems behave in the real world.

### ⚖️Decide is data engineering right for you?<br>

  - [ ]  “**Yes** — this feels right. I want to commit and learn it properly.”
  - [ ]  “**No** — this isn’t for me, and that’s okay.”
    
*Choose one that matters most and be honest with yourself. Ignore hype and salary — ask whether you would genuinely enjoy doing this work every week.*
